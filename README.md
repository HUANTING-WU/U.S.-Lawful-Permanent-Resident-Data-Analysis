# U.S.-Lawful-Permanent-Resident-Data-Analysis

* **Historical data of various immigration statistics yearbooks can be retrieved [here](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook)**
* **2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics can be retrieve [here](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016#*)**

The basic motivation for this assignment is try to create a nice visualization package to demonstrate various aspects of green card statistics in the U.S. Therefore, the fundamental research question is: what is the reality of permanent residence immigration in the U.S.? Starting from this driving question, various subordinate aspects of the data are included, such as:
* Gross historical trend.
* Categorization by residence region before immigration.
* Relation between personal income and propensity to immigration in different regions.

**Note that this program is by no means entirely comprehensive. The demonstrated aspects below are merely selected based on the author's sole judgments. In fact, the author will grudgingly admit that statistics published by the Pew Research Center on unauthorized immigration in the U.S. are hesitantly excluded, in order to avoid controversial grading**

## The first dataset is the historical data from 1820 to 2016
* This dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016/table1)

## The second dataset is categorization by regions of residence from 1820 to 2016
* This dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016/table2)
* Note that categorization by region of birth seems to be only available from 2007 to 2016

## The third dataset is average real GDP per capita by regions
* This dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2018)
* Values are in 2011 USD.

## The fourth dataset is to combine each continent's green card addmission per decade and real gdp per capita per decade together and explore their relationship.
* Note that data prior to 1950s are excluded for the purpose of consistency.
