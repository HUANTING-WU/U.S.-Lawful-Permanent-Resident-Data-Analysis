The basic motivation for this assignment is try to create a nice visualization package to demonstrate various aspects of green card statistics in the U.S. Therefore, the fundamental research question is: what is the reality of permanent residence immigration in the U.S.? Starting from this driving question, various subordinate aspects of the data are included, such as:
* Gross historical trend.
* Categorization by residence region before immigration.
* Relation between personal income and propensity to immigration in different regions.

**Note that this program is by no means entirely comprehensive. The demonstrated aspects below are merely selected based on the author's sole judgments. In fact, the author will grudgingly admit that statistics published by the Pew Research Center on unauthorized immigration in the U.S. are hesitantly excluded, in order to avoid controversial grading **
